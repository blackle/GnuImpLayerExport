# Gnu-Imp Layer Exporter

This repository provides the script `gnuimp_layer_export.py` that will export all the layers of a given xcf file to a given folder. This program uses [TheHeadlessSourceMan's
gimpFormats module.](https://github.com/TheHeadlessSourceMan/gimpFormats)

```
Usage: ./gnuimp_layer_export.py image.xcf output_folder/
```

## Does this work with GIMP?

Yes, I just call GIMP "Gnu-Imp" because I hate its name.
